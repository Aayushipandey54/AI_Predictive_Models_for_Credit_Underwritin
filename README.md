# 🚀 AI Predictive Models for Credit Underwriting  
Leverage AI-powered predictive models to revolutionize credit underwriting and streamline decision-making.

---

## 📜 Overview  
This project enhances the accuracy and efficiency of credit underwriting using AI-based predictive models. By analyzing historical financial data, the system predicts the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan, empowering financial institutions with data-driven insights.

## 🛠️ About  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Leverages machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, feature selection, and transformation.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Implements metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Visualizations**: Provides clear visual insights into model performance and decision boundaries.  

---

## 🌟 Features  
- 🌐 **Two Apps**:  
  - Flask App: Traditional web application.  
  - Streamlit App: Interactive dashboard for predictions.  
- 🔄 **Input Preprocessing**: Includes log transformations and one-hot encoding.  
- 📊 **Pre-trained Model**: A machine learning model (`model.pkl`) ready for predictions.  

---

## 💻 Requirements  
- **Python 3.x**  
- Required Libraries:  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn`  
  - `streamlit`  
  - `flask`

## ⚙️ Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aayushipandey54/AI_Predictive_Models_for_Credit_Underwriting.git  
   cd AI_Predictive_Models_for_Credit_Underwriting  

----------------------

## ⚡ How It Works
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Clean the dataset (handle missing values and outliers).
Encode categorical variables.
Split data into training and testing sets.
2️⃣ Model Training
Trains the following models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Neural Networks
3️⃣ Model Evaluation
Evaluates models using:

Confusion Matrix
Cross-validation
Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
4️⃣ Predictions
Generates predictions on unseen data for credit risk assessment.
--------------

## 🛠️ Usage
1.To train and evaluate the models, run:
```bash
python main.py
```

2.For predictions, use either:
Flask App:
```bash
flask run
```
----

3.Streamlit App:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

------------------------------------


## 📈 Results
Model Accuracy: Displays performance metrics for all trained models.
Confusion Matrix: Helps analyze errors.
ROC-AUC Curve: Provides visualization of model performance.

### Things to Note:
1. **Images**: If you have local images, ensure the path is relative to your repository structure (like `images/system-architecture.png`).
2. **Video**: Only links to platforms that support video embedding (like YouTube or Vimeo) can be embedded. Markdown itself does not support direct video embedding.

Once you update your `README.md` with these changes, you can see the image and video in the rendered view on GitHub or other Markdown viewers.
